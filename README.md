# Flowise-AI Agents Use Cases

This repository contains a collection of practical use cases for FlowiseAI agents. Each project demonstrates how to build specialized AI assistants using the FlowiseAI platform with visual workflows.

## Available Use Cases

### 1. [Research Agent](./Research%20Agent/README.md)

A research assistant workflow that helps users find answers by searching the web, performing calculations, and retrieving up-to-date information. This agent provides accurate responses to various queries, from mathematical computations to factual questions.

### 2. [Invoice Analyzer](./Invoice%20Analyzer/README.md)

An invoice processing workflow that extracts structured data from invoice PDFs. The agent parses and organizes relevant information like invoice number, date, vendor details, and line items into a clean, structured format.

## Future Projects

This repository will continue to grow with more FlowiseAI use cases. Upcoming projects will explore different AI agent capabilities and practical business applications.

## Getting Started

Each use case has its own directory with:

- A detailed README explaining the workflow
- JSON configuration file for importing into FlowiseAI
- Example images and sample outputs
- Any additional resources needed

To use these workflows:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the use case you're interested in
3. Import the JSON configuration into your FlowiseAI instance
4. Follow the specific instructions in the use case README
